# Arique's E-Commerce

Hello and welcome!  I am creating an e-commerce store within Javascript/React and full Authentication with Firebase Databse Storage, sprinkled with some Stripe-Integration, which bought the fin-tech company I worked at for a bit called TaxJar.

As a Backend Ruby Developer, it's amazing to be able to code in Javascript, but I'm still learning a lot!

Feel free to walk through my technical reviews as I iterate over them what I'm learning about Javascript.

## About the Author
My name is Arique Furia Aguilar pronouns they/them and I am an organizer turned software engineer.

I recently served as the Community Manager for MoveOnâ€™s product Spoke. An open-source product that delivers access to texting-technology at a jaw dropping penny-per-text.

Spoke is written in Javascript/Nodejs.  My primary contributions included integration requirements for Azure, AWS, Heroku, Twilio, and VAN.  I hosted weekly Hacknights and eventually grew in establishing creative sprint cycles for volunteer dev teams I recruited and trained.

When the utility of our product dropped significantly, I was able to identify that it was due to limited understanding of the implications or standards for sending texts - also known as 10DLC regulation.  

As my final contribution to Spoke, I was able to coordinate efforts towards identifying an new home that would support smaller organizations in their 10DLC Regulation Compliance journey - effectively securing the accessibility of this tool for many campaigns to come. 

I'm interested in staying within Progressive Tech and am currently seeking contracts with research teams looking to protect voters rights and access to the poles.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
